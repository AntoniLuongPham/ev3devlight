# ev3devlight
Lightweight ev3dev Micropython and Python library.

Not quite ready for general use, but feel free to look around.

To try it, copy or clone everything to the EV3 and try one of the [examples](https://github.com/laurensvalk/ev3devlight-examples).

Note that micropython only comes preinstalled on the [stretch versions of the latest SD card images](https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/). The library should work on Jessie builds with Python too.
