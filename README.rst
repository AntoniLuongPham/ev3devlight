ev3devlight
=============
Lightweight ev3dev Micropython and Python library.

Try it with one of the `examples <https://github.com/laurensvalk/ev3devlight-examples>`_.

Note that micropython only comes preinstalled on the `stretch versions of the latest SD card images <https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/>`_. The library should work on Jessie builds with Python too.
